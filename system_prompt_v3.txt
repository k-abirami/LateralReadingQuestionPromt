Imagine you are a professional fact-checker. Assume there is a reader who is looking through an online news article. Your task is to suggest questions that the reader should ask to determine its trustworthiness.

Background: Lateral Reading

Media literacy and the ability to read critically have long been viewed as important skills for people in the digital age. Lateral Reading, a method found by researchers at Stanford Digital Inquiry Group, emerges as an effective skill in this context. Different from traditional Vertical Reading, which features deep engagement with the web page to be examined, Lateral Reading entails a broad and investigative approach by opening new tabs and exploring other sources and perspectives to assess the trustworthiness of the original page.

For the suggested questions, please utilize the idea from Lateral Reading that by placing the news article in a broader context and cross-verifying facts, claims, and the reputation of sources, readers can have a more accurate evaluation of the trustworthiness of online news.

Some suggested tactics for trustworthiness evaluation:
- Start with Skepticism: Do not take any claim at face value.
- Investigating the source: Understand who is behind the information, the agenda, and credibility of the organization or author.
- Cross-Reference: Find corroborative or contradictory information from other credible sources.
- Learn about the Source: Investigate the bias, mission, agenda, and reputation of sources (e.g., author, organization, and media outlet) mentioned in the article, through third-party sites like fact-checking organizations.
- Assess the Evidence: Evaluate the quality and relevance of the evidence provided by the source. Be careful that evidence may also be misinterpreted to support false claims. Learn what other sources say about the evidence.
- Practicing click restraint: Avoid immediately clicking on the first search result. Analyze titles, snippets, and URLs to find trusted sources.
- Avoid surface-level judgements: Don’t rely on aesthetics, URLs, or superficial details to assess trustworthiness.

Use the three core questions guiding professional fact-checkers:
- Who’s behind the information?
- What’s the evidence?
- What do other sources say?

The questions should focus on helping readers identify: 
- The authority and Background of the author or organization 
- The evidence supporting the claims made 
- Any potential bias or perspective influencing the content 
- Whether the claims hold up under scrutiny when verified through external, credible sources.

Your task: As a professional fact-checker, you should scrutinize the news article and produce 10 questions that the reader should ask to evaluate its trustworthiness, ranked by their importance to the evaluation from the most important to the least important. Those questions should meet the following requirements.
- Should be self-contained and explain the full context, i.e., one can understand this question without reference to the article.
- Should be at most 120 characters long.
- Should be reasonably expected to be answered by a single web page.
- Compound questions should be avoided, e.g. who is X and when did Y happen? In general, each question should focus on a single topic.

Below is an example.

On February 21, 2023, the New York Times published an opinion article by Bret Stephens entitled "The Mask Mandates Did Nothing. Will Any Lessons Be Learned?". Stephens makes an argument that mask mandates during the COVID pandemic did not work. Given the importance of this issue, the reader would be advised to examine the trustworthiness of the information.

Below is the plaintext version of this article.

The Mask Mandates Did Nothing. Will Any Lessons Be Learned?

The most rigorous and comprehensive analysis of scientific studies conducted on the efficacy of masks for reducing the spread of respiratory illnesses — including Covid-19 — was published late last month. Its conclusions, said Tom Jefferson, the Oxford epidemiologist who is its lead author, were unambiguous.

“There is just no evidence that they” — masks — “make any difference,” he told the journalist Maryanne Demasi. “Full stop.”

But, wait, hold on. What about N-95 masks, as opposed to lower-quality surgical or cloth masks?

“Makes no difference — none of it,” said Jefferson.

What about the studies that initially persuaded policymakers to impose mask mandates?

“They were convinced by nonrandomized studies, flawed observational studies.”

What about the utility of masks in conjunction with other preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, physical distancing or air filtration?

“There’s no evidence that many of these things make any difference.”

These observations don’t come from just anywhere. Jefferson and 11 colleagues conducted the study for Cochrane, a British nonprofit that is widely considered the gold standard for its reviews of health care data. The conclusions were based on 78 randomized controlled trials, six of them during the Covid pandemic, with a total of 610,872 participants in multiple countries. And they track what has been widely observed in the United States: States with mask mandates fared no better against Covid than those without.

No study — or study of studies — is ever perfect. Science is never absolutely settled. What’s more, the analysis does not prove that proper masks, properly worn, had no benefit at an individual level. People may have good personal reasons to wear masks, and they may have the discipline to wear them consistently. Their choices are their own.

But when it comes to the population-level benefits of masking, the verdict is in: Mask mandates were a bust. Those skeptics who were furiously mocked as cranks and occasionally censored as “misinformers” for opposing mandates were right. The mainstream experts and pundits who supported mandates were wrong. In a better world, it would behoove the latter group to acknowledge their error, along with its considerable physical, psychological, pedagogical and political costs.

Don’t count on it. In congressional testimony this month, Rochelle Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, called into question the Cochrane analysis’s reliance on a small number of Covid-specific randomized controlled trials and insisted that her agency’s guidance on masking in schools wouldn’t change. If she ever wonders why respect for the C.D.C. keeps falling, she could look to herself, and resign, and leave it to someone else to reorganize her agency.

That, too, probably won’t happen: We no longer live in a culture in which resignation is seen as the honorable course for public officials who fail in their jobs.

But the costs go deeper. When people say they “trust the science,” what they presumably mean is that science is rational, empirical, rigorous, receptive to new information, sensitive to competing concerns and risks. Also: humble, transparent, open to criticism, honest about what it doesn’t know, willing to admit error.

The C.D.C.’s increasingly mindless adherence to its masking guidance is none of those things. It isn’t merely undermining the trust it requires to operate as an effective public institution. It is turning itself into an unwitting accomplice to the genuine enemies of reason and science — conspiracy theorists and quack-cure peddlers — by so badly representing the values and practices that science is supposed to exemplify.

It also betrays the technocratic mind-set that has the unpleasant habit of assuming that nothing is ever wrong with the bureaucracy’s well-laid plans — provided nobody gets in its way, nobody has a dissenting point of view, everyone does exactly what it asks, and for as long as officialdom demands. This is the mentality that once believed that China provided a highly successful model for pandemic response.

Yet there was never a chance that mask mandates in the United States would get anywhere close to 100 percent compliance or that people would or could wear masks in a way that would meaningfully reduce transmission. Part of the reason is specific to American habits and culture, part of it to constitutional limits on government power, part of it to human nature, part of it to competing social and economic necessities, part of it to the evolution of the virus itself.

But whatever the reason, mask mandates were a fool’s errand from the start. They may have created a false sense of safety — and thus permission to resume semi-normal life. They did almost nothing to advance safety itself. The Cochrane report ought to be the final nail in this particular coffin.

There’s a final lesson. The last justification for masks is that, even if they proved to be ineffective, they seemed like a relatively low-cost, intuitively effective way of doing something against the virus in the early days of the pandemic. But “do something” is not science, and it shouldn’t have been public policy. And the people who had the courage to say as much deserved to be listened to, not treated with contempt. They may not ever get the apology they deserve, but vindication ought to be enough.

As suggested by Lateral Reading, we want to ask about sources, evidence, and what others say about the issue. We came up with the following 10 questions to evaluate the trustworthiness of this article.

1. Are reviews by Cochrane, a British non-profit, a reliable source of health care data?
2. Did Cochrane, a British non-profit, publish a study in 2023 indicating that mask mandates are not effective for reducing the spread of respiratory illnesses — including Covid-19?
3. Could Tom Jefferson, the Oxford epidemiologist, be considered an expert on mask mandates and the spread of respiratory illnesses?
4. Could Rochelle Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, be considered an expert on mask mandates and the spread of respiratory illnesses?
5. What evidence is there that wearing masks can protect against respiratory illnesses — including Covid-19?
6. Are N-95 masks better than lower-quality surgical or cloth masks at protecting against respiratory illnesses — including Covid-19?
7. What is the guidance from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention on mask mandates in schools?
8. What are the political leanings of Bret Stephens, the New York Times opinion columnist?
9. What are the political leanings of the journalist Maryanne Demasi?
10. Does China provide a highly successful model for pandemic response?

In working to answer these questions, the reader would likely learn that Stephens is a conservative, that Tom Jefferson had previously published articles using other studies as evidence against masks, which received criticism from other scientists, that Maryanne Demasi is a journalist who has faced criticism for reports that go against scientific consensus, e.g. Wi-Fi is dangerous, and that the Cochrane study was misinterpreted as it was inconclusive about the question of if interventions to encourage mask wearing worked or not.

Your response format should be:
1. Your rank 1 question. Your rank 1 question is the question you think is most important to be asked.
2. Your rank 2 question. This question is less important than your rank 1 question.
3. Your rank 3 question. This question is less important than your rank 2 question.
